# Exercise 5

To encourage good grades, Hermosa High School has decided to award each ­student a bookstore credit that is 10 times the student’s grade point average. In other words, a student with a 3.2 grade point average receives a $32 credit. ­Create a class that prompts a student for a name and grade point average, and then passes the values to a method that displays a descriptive message. The ­message uses the student’s name, echoes the grade point average, and computes and displays the credit. Save the application as BookstoreCredit.java.

# Exercise 6

There are 12 inches in a foot and 3 feet in a yard. Create a class named InchConversion. Its main() method accepts a value in inches from a user at the keyboard, and in turn passes the entered value to two methods. One converts the value from inches to feet, and the other converts the same value from inches to yards. Each method displays the results with appropriate explanation. Save the application as InchConversion.java.

# Exercise 7

Assume that a gallon of paint covers about 350 square feet of wall space. Create
an application with a main() method that prompts the user for the length, width,
and height of a rectangular room. Pass these three values to a method that does
the following:

* Calculates the wall area for a room
* Passes the calculated wall area to another method that calculates and returns
the number of gallons of paint needed
* Displays the number of gallons needed
* Computes the price based on a paint price of $32 per gallon, assuming that
the painter can buy any fraction of a gallon of paint at the same price as a
whole gallon
* Returns the price of the main() method

The main() method displays the final price. For example, the cost to paint a 15-by-20-foot room with 10-foot ceilings is $64. Save the application as PaintCalculator.java.

# Exercise 8

The Harrison Group Life Insurance company computes annual policy premiums based on the age the customer turns in the current calendar year. The premium is computed by taking the decade of the customer’s age, adding 15 to it, and ­multiplying by 20. For example, a 34-year-old would pay $360, which is calculated by adding the decades (3) to 15, and then multiplying by 20. Write an application that prompts a user for the current year and a birth year. Pass both to a method that calculates and returns the premium amount, and then display the returned amount. Save the application as Insurance.java.

# Exercise 9

Herbert's Home Repair estimates each job cost as the cost of materials plus $35 per hour while on the job, plus $12 per hour for travel time to the job site. Create a class that contains a main() method that prompts the user for the name of a job (for example, Smith bathroom remodel), the cost of materials, the number of hours of work required, and the number of hours travel time. Pass the numeric data to a method that computes estimate for the job and returns the computed value to the main() method where the job name and estimated price are displayed. Save the program as JobPricing.java.

# Exercise 10

Create a class named FormLetterWriter that includes two overloaded methods named displaySalutation(). The first method takes one String parameter that represents a customer’s first name, and it displays the salutation Dear followed by the first name. The second method accepts two String parameters that represent a first and last name, and it displays the greeting Dear followed by the first name, a space, and the last name. After each salutation, display the rest of a short business letter: Thank you for your recent order. Write a main() method that prompts the user for a first and last name and tests each overloaded method. Save the file as FormLetterWriter.java.
