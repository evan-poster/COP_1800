// TestLease.java

/**
 * Exercise 2:
 * 
 * #DONE Create a class named TestLease whose main() method declares four Lease objects named lease1, lease2, lease3, and lease4.
 *
 * #DONE Create a getData() method that prompts a user for values for each field for a Lease, and return a newly constructed Lease object to the main() method, where it is assigned to one of main()â€™s first three Lease objects.
 *
 * #DONE Do not prompt the user for values for the fourth Lease object, but let it hold the default values.
 * 
 * #DONE After the four Lease objects have been assigned values, pass the lease1 object to a showValues() method that displays the data.
 * 
 * #DONE Then call the addPetFee() method with the lease1 object, and confirm that the fee explanation statement is displayed.
 * 
 * #DONE Next, call the showValues() method for the lease1 object again and confirm that the pet fee has been added to the rent.
 * 
 * #DONE Finally, call the showValues() method with each of the other three objects.
 * 
 * #DONE Confirm that three hold the values you supplied as input and one holds the constructor default values. Save the application as TestLease.java.
