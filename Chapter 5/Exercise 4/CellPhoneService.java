 * Write a program for Horizon Phones, a provider of cellular phone service.
 * 
 * Prompt a user for maximum monthly values for:
 * 		talk minutes needed
 * 		text messages needed
 * 		gigabytes of data needed
 * then display a recommendation for the best plan for the customerâ€™s needs.
 * A customer who needs fewer than 500 minutes of talk and no text or data should buy Plan A at $49 per month.
 * A customer who needs fewer than 500 minutes of talk and any text messages should buy Plan B at $55 per month.
 * A customer who needs 500 or more minutes of talk and no data should buy either Plan C for up to 100 text messages at $61 per month or Plan D for 100 text messages or more at $70 per month.
 * A customer who needs any data should buy Plan E for up to 3 gigabytes at $79 per month or Plan F for 3 gigabytes or more at $87 per month.
 * 
 * Save the file as CellPhoneService.java.
